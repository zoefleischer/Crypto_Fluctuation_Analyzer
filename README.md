# Crypto_Fluctuation_Analyzer
 
 In this project I used Webscraping Tools in order to get recent articles from
 crypto-related news sites.
 These articles were first analyzed for content, in order to establish which crypto they are about,
 and hence for sentiment.
 If the program would identify that there is negative news about a cryptocurrency, it would send
 out an automated email notification to the user.
